Pursuant to one such agreement, the Sprint PCS Management Agreement, dated November\u00a05, 1999 (as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time, the \u201cManagement Agreement\u201d), Sprint PCS was granted an option to purchase Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunications assets used to provide services pursuant to the Management Agreement.

(\u201cT-Mobile\u201d), on behalf of and as the direct or indirect owner of Sprint PCS, exercised its option by delivering a binding notice of exercise to Shentel.
