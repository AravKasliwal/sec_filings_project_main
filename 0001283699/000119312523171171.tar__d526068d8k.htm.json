A three-year cycle for the advisory say-on-pay vote will provide investors the most meaningful timing alternative by which to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s executive compensation strategies and their alignment with the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Board also believes that a three-year vote cycle for the advisory say-on-pay vote will give the Board sufficient time to thoughtfully consider the results of the advisory vote and to implement any desired changes to the Company\u2019s executive compensation policies and procedures. Based on the Board of Directors\u2019 recommendation in the Proxy Statement and the voting results with respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation, the Company has adopted a policy to hold an advisory vote to approve executive compensation every three years.",
