Therefore, we have historically accessed EBS spectrum primarily through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. In April 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. The elimination of these restrictions allows current license holders to sell their licenses, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses, but we continue to lease spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time."

The FCC\u2019s RIF Order expressly preempted such state efforts, which were inconsistent with the FCC\u2019s federal deregulatory approach at that time. In 2019, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local measures regulating broadband services. The court left open the prospect that particular state laws could still unlawfully conflict with the FCC\u2019s RIF Order and be preempted. In the meantime, the FCC sought to repeal the RIF Order through its adoption of the 2024 Open Internet Order, though the latter was struck down by a federal court of appeals in January 2025."

For example, California has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation, while many others have passed privacy laws, and New York has passed a broadband rate-setting law. There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements. Ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws, is critical to this effort. If not preempted or rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. A number of states also subject wireless service providers to registration requirements. State authority over wireless broadband services will likely remain unsettled unless resolved by the courts, the FCC or Congress."

To the extent any debtholders do not participate in the exchange, their bonds will continue as obligations of UScellular, and the cash portion of the purchase price will be correspondingly increased. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, subject to customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. Upon closing of the transaction, we expect to account for the UScellular transaction as a business combination and to consolidate the acquired operations. We expect this transaction will yield approximately $1.0 billion in total annual run rate cost synergies, including operating expense and capital expenditure synergies, upon integration, with total cost to achieve the integration currently estimated at between $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion."
