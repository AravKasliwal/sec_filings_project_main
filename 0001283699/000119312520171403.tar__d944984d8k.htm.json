As a result, we believe all conditions to closing under the Asset Purchase Agreement (other than those conditions that can only be satisfied at closing) have been satisfied and, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions that must be satisfied at closing, the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale will occur on July 1, 2020."

The parties have also agreed to amend the definition of the \u201cTermination Date\u201d in the Asset Purchase Agreement so that either party may terminate the Asset Purchase Agreement if the Closing has not occurred before the end of the day on July\u00a01, 2020 (from June 30, 2020), subject to other terms and conditions provided under the Asset Purchase Agreement.
