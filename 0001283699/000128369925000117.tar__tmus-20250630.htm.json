At closing, we expect to invest approximately $4.6\u00a0billion, adjusted for Metronet\u2019s incremental pre-close debt financing, to acquire a 50% equity interest in the joint venture and all existing residential fiber customers, as well as funding of the joint venture. We do not anticipate making further capital contributions following the closing under the existing business plan. Following the joint acquisition, Metronet will become a wholesale services provider, and its residential fiber retail operations and customers will transition to us. On July 9, 2025, we received all necessary regulatory approvals, and the joint acquisition of Metronet is expected to close on July 24, 2025."

Those Litigation and Regulatory Matters are at various stages, and some of them may proceed to trial, arbitration, hearing, or other adjudication that could result in fines, penalties, or awards of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. We have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matters, where appropriate. The accruals are reflected on our condensed consolidated financial statements, but they are not considered to be, individually or in the aggregate, material. An accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. For other matters, where we have not determined that a loss is probable or because the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, we have not recorded an accrual due to various factors typical in contested proceedings, including, but not limited to, uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators, uncertain damage theories and demands, and a less than fully developed factual record. For Litigation and Regulatory Matters that may result in a contingent gain, we recognize such gains on our condensed consolidated financial statements when the gain is realized or realizable. We recognize legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with Litigation and Regulatory Matters as they are incurred. Except as otherwise specified below, we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these Litigation and Regulatory Matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matters identified below, or other matters that we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse impact on results of operations or cash flows for a particular period. This assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant facts and circumstances. As such, our view of these matters is subject to inherent uncertainties and may change in the future."

In September 2019, Sprint notified the FCC that it had claimed monthly subsidies for serving subscribers, even though these subscribers may not have met usage requirements under Sprint's usage policy for the Lifeline program, due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in July 2017 while the system was being updated.

On April 1, 2025, we completed the joint acquisition of Lumos, upon the completion of certain customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. During the three months ended June\u00a030, 2025, we invested $932\u00a0million to acquire a 50% equity interest in the joint venture and 97,000 fiber customers. The funds invested by us will be used to fund future fiber builds. In addition, pursuant to the definitive agreement, we expect to make an additional capital contribution of approximately $500\u00a0million between 2027 and 2028 under the existing business plan. Following the joint acquisition, Lumos transitioned to a wholesale model where we are the anchor tenant owning residential and small business customer relationships. We account for the Lumos joint venture under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of earnings presented within Other (expense) income, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We recognize revenues for fiber customers and the related wholesale costs paid to the joint venture for network access within Postpaid revenues and Cost of services, respectively, on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income."
