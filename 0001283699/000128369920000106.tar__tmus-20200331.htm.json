The new credit loss standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount. The new credit loss standard became effective for us, and we adopted the standard, on January 1, 2020.

We have developed an expected credit loss model incorporating forward-looking loss indicators.
