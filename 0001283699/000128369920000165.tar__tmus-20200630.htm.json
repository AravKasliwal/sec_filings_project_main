As a result, our business, liquidity, financial condition, and operating results have been, and will continue to be, adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a widespread increase in unemployment and is expected to result in reduced consumer spending and has resulted in a recession beginning in February 2020. In addition, public and private sector policies and initiatives to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, the promotion of social distancing, the adoption of work-from-home initiatives, government forbearance programs and online learning by companies and institutions, could affect our operations, consumer and business spending, and the amount and ways our customers use our networks and our other products and services. In addition, COVID-19 may affect the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us and our customers\u2019 ability to timely pay for services. Further, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to extreme disruption and volatility in the global capital markets and may lead to a significant economic recession, which could have a further adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results, including potentially decreased access to capital markets or a reduced ability to issue debt on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, there may be a potential impairment of goodwill, spectrum licenses or long-lived assets if the adverse impact on operating results and cash flows continues for a prolonged period of time. During the quarter, while the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic peaked and subsequently subsided in some jurisdictions, leading to phased re-openings, other areas have seen resurgences of COVID-19 cases and continuing or renewed containment measures."

Pursuant to the MNSA, DISH will receive network services from the Company for a period of seven years. As set forth in the MNSA, the Company will provide to DISH, among other things, (a) legacy network services for certain Boost Mobile prepaid end users on the Sprint network, (b) T-Mobile network services for certain end users that have been migrated to the T-Mobile network or provisioned on the T-Mobile network by or on behalf of DISH and (c) infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network. Pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, DISH is expected to purchase all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion. The covered spectrum sale will not occur before the third anniversary of the Merger (i.e., not before April 1, 2023) but must be divested within the later of three years after the closing of the Divestiture Transaction and five days after receipt of the approval from the FCC for the transfer, following an application for FCC approval to be filed by the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger. T-Mobile may exercise an option to lease back 4 MHz (2 MHz downlink + 2 MHz uplink) of the spectrum for two years following the closing of the 800 MHz spectrum sale at the same per person rate used to calculate the purchase price paid by DISH to T-Mobile \u2013 a rate of approximately $68 million per year."
