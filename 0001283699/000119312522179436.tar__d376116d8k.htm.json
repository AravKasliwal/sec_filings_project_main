As disclosed therein, the Term Sheet was subject to approval by the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Antitrust Division (the \u201cDOJ\u201d) in accordance with the Final Judgment entered into on April\u00a01, 2020, among T-Mobile, DISH, the DOJ, and certain plaintiff states named therein. On June\u00a021, 2022, the Parties were notified by the DOJ that approval has been granted. As such, the Term Sheet is now effective and T-Mobile and DISH have commenced negotiating in good faith an amendment to the MNSA and any other necessary agreements in order to further effectuate such modifications. Until such time as the definitive agreements are entered into (and whether or not any such definitive agreements are ever finalized, executed, and entered into), the Term Sheet, and all of the obligations contained within the Term Sheet, is in full force and effect and binding upon the parties.",
