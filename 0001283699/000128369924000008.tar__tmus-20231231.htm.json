Our ESG initiatives are subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including regarding the evolving nature of data availability, quality, and assessment; related methodological concerns; our ability to implement various initiatives under expected timeframes, cost, and complexity; our dependency on third parties to provide certain information and to comply with applicable laws and policies; and other unforeseen events or conditions. For example, we note that standards and expectations regarding greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) accounting and the processes for measuring and counting GHG emissions and GHG emission reductions are evolving, and it is possible that our approaches both to measuring our emissions and to reducing emissions and measuring those reductions may be, either currently by some stakeholders or at some point in the future, considered inconsistent with common or best practices with respect to measuring and accounting for such matters, and reducing overall emissions. These factors, as well as others, may cause results to differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Additionally, we may provide information that is not necessarily material for SEC reporting purposes but that is informed by various ESG standards and frameworks (including standards for the measurement of underlying data), internal controls, and assumptions or third-party information that are still evolving and subject to change.

In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller and regional providers, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Cox Communications, Inc., and Altice USA, Inc., many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some of our competitors have shown a willingness to use discounted pricing or offer bundled services as a potential source of differentiation."

While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority both to revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such noncompliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses or our competitive position in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers\u2019 spectrum holdings in the context of spectrum transactions or acquisitions. Most recently, for example, in September 2023, the FCC sought public comment on whether it should initiate a rulemaking proceeding to consider changes to its mobile spectrum rules and policies.

Therefore, we have historically accessed EBS spectrum primarily through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. The elimination of these restrictions allows current license holders to sell their licenses, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market"

In 2019, however, the DC Circuit issued a ruling largely upholding the RIF Order, but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state/local measures regulating broadband services.

There are also efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements.

For example, in 2015 and 2016, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules were largely rolled back in 2017, the FCC recently initiated a rulemaking proceeding proposing to reinstate the net neutrality rules, to reassert authority in the broadband privacy arena, and to subject broadband offerings to other forms of regulatory oversight. In addition, the current FCC updated transparency obligations to require nutrition-style broadband label disclosures in 2024 that could prompt regulatory inquiries. In addition, some states and other jurisdictions have enacted laws in these areas (including, for example, California and other states\u2019 net neutrality laws, the CCPA and CPRA as discussed below) and others are considering enacting similar laws.

We are cooperating fully with regulators and vigorously defending against the class actions and other lawsuits. On July 22, 2022, we entered into an agreement to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit. On June 29, 2023, the Court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement, which is subject to potential appeals. Under the terms of the settlement, we would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and the costs of administering the settlement. We would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023. We previously paid $35 million for claims administration purposes. On July 31, 2023, a class member filed an appeal to the final approval order challenging the Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to class counsel. We expect the remaining portion of the $350 million settlement payment to fund claims to be made once that appeal is resolved.

The purchase price is variable dependent upon specified performance indicators of Ka\u2019ena during certain periods before and after closing and consists of an upfront payment at closing of the transaction, subject to certain agreed-upon working capital and other adjustments, and a variable earnout payable 24 months after closing of the transaction. Our estimate of the upfront payment is subject to Ka\u2019ena\u2019s underlying business performance and the timing of transaction close, and has been updated to $1.2 billion, before working capital and other adjustments. The acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2024."

We also expect an increase in Prepaid revenues, partially offset by a decrease in Wholesale and other service revenues, upon the closing of our previously announced acquisition of Ka\u2019ena.
