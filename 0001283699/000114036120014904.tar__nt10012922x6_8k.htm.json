the risk of future material weaknesses resulting from the differences between T-Mobile\u2019s\n      and Sprint\u2019s internal controls environments as we work to integrate and align guidelines and practices; the impacts of the actions we have taken and conditions we have agreed to in connection with the regulatory approvals of the Transactions\n      including costs or difficulties related to the completion of the divestiture of Sprint\u2019s prepaid wireless businesses to DISH Network Corporation and the satisfaction of any related government commitments to such divestiture and any other commitments\n      or undertakings that we have entered into; natural disasters, public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, terrorist attacks or similar incidents, and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on us and our customers and other\n      stakeholders; competition, industry consolidation and changes in the market for wireless services, which could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customers; the effects of any future merger, investment, or acquisition involving us,\n      as well as the effects of mergers, investments or acquisitions in the technology, media and telecommunications industry; our business, investor confidence in our financial results and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls are\n      not effective; the effects of the material weakness in Sprint\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting or the identification of any additional material weaknesses as we complete our assessment of the Sprint control environment;

unfavorable outcomes of existing or future litigation or regulatory actions, including\n      litigation or regulatory actions related to the Transactions; the possibility that we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of others; changes in tax laws,\n      regulations and existing standards and the resolution of disputes with any taxing jurisdictions; the possibility that we may be unable to renew our spectrum licenses on attractive terms or acquire new spectrum licenses at reasonable costs and terms;\n      any disruption or failure of our third parties\u2019 (including key suppliers\u2019) provisioning of products or services; material adverse changes in labor matters, including labor campaigns, negotiations or additional organizing activity, and any resulting\n      financial, operational and/or reputational impact; changes in accounting assumptions that regulatory agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, may require, which could result in an impact on earnings;
