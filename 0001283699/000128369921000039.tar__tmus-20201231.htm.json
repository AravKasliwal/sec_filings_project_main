We believe this layer cake will broaden and deepen our nationwide 5G network enabling accelerated innovation and increased competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries.

Pursuant to the MNSA, DISH will receive network services from the Company for a period of seven years. As set forth in the MNSA, the Company will provide DISH, among other things, (a) legacy network services for certain Boost Mobile prepaid end users on the Sprint network, (b) T-Mobile network services for certain end users that have been migrated to the T-Mobile network or provisioned on the T-Mobile network by or on behalf of DISH and (c) infrastructure mobile network operator services to assist in the access and integration of the DISH network. Pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, DISH has agreed to purchase all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion; provided, however, that if DISH breaches the Spectrum Purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH\u2019s sole liability will be to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. In such instance, T-Mobile may be required to conduct an auction sale of all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum under the terms set forth in the Consent Decree, but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount less than $3.6 billion. The covered spectrum sale will not occur before the third anniversary of the Merger (i.e., not before April 1, 2023), but must be divested within the later of three years after the closing of the Divestiture Transaction and five days after receipt of the approval from the FCC for the transfer, following an application for FCC approval to be filed by the third anniversary of the closing of the Merger. T-Mobile may exercise an option to lease back 4 MHz (2 MHz downlink + 2 MHz uplink) of the spectrum for two years following the closing of the 800 MHz spectrum sale at the same per person rate used to calculate the purchase price paid by DISH to T-Mobile \u2013 a rate of approximately $68 million per year."

Similarly, in response to the Pandemic, starting in January 2021 and extending at least 90 days, the California Public Utilities Commission adopted a resolution providing a moratorium on customer disconnects and late fees for certain California customers facing financial hardship. Additionally, under the Obama administration, the FCC established net neutrality and privacy regimes that applied to our operations. Both sets of rules potentially subjected some of our initiatives and practices to more burdensome requirements and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulators, the public, edge providers, and private litigants regarding whether such initiatives or practices are compliant. While the FCC rules were largely rolled back under the Trump administration, the FCC could possibly revisit that decision under the Biden administration.

We employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization.

The Greenfield methodology values the spectrum licenses by calculating the cash flow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the asset to be valued (in this case, spectrum licenses) and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant.

(\u201cCCI\u201d) under the leaseback of $1.1 billion. Additionally, $1.7 billion in other long-term liabilities were recognized associated with contract terms that are unfavorable to current market rates, which includes unfavorable terms associated with the fixed-price purchase option in 2037. Prior to the Merger, Sprint entered into a lease-out and leaseback arrangement with Global Signal Inc., a third party that was subsequently acquired by CCI, that conveyed to CCI the exclusive right to manage and operate approximately 6,400 tower sites via prepaid master lease. These agreements were assumed upon the close of the Merger, at which point the remaining term of the lease-out was approximately 17 years with no renewal options. CCI has a fixed-price purchase option for all (but not less than all) of the leased or subleased sites for approximately $2.3 billion, exercisable one year prior to the expiration of the agreement and ending 120 days prior to the expiration of the agreement. The Company leases back a portion of the space at certain tower sites for an initial term of 10 years, followed by optional renewals at customary terms."

This balance was adjusted to zero as part of our purchase price allocation. Contract costs capitalized for new postpaid contracts will accumulate in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets from the Merger close date. As a result, there was a net benefit to Operating income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income during the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, as capitalization of costs exceed amortization. As capitalized costs amortize into expense over time, the accretive benefit to Operating income is expected to moderate in 2021 and normalize in 2022."
