Pursuant to one such agreement, the Sprint PCS Management Agreement, dated November\u00a05, 1999 (as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time, the \u201cManagement Agreement\u201d), Sprint PCS was granted an option to purchase Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunications assets.

Issuance of the Notice of Dispute by Shentel triggers a dispute resolution process set out in the Management Agreement that may lead the parties to extend or otherwise adjust the timeline for the appraisal process and purchase of Shentel\u2019s wireless telecommunications assets. Should the parties fail to resolve a dispute within 60 days following delivery of the Notice of Dispute, either party may pursue other remedies, as permitted by the Management Agreement.
