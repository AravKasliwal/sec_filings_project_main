We are the second largest provider of wireless communications services in the U.S. as measured by our total postpaid and prepaid customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (\u201cAT&T\u201d) and Verizon Communications, Inc. (\u201cVerizon\u201d). In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, MVNOs, including Comcast Corporation, Charter Communications, Inc., Altice USA, Inc. and DISH, many of which offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless communications services industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing or offering bundled services as a source of differentiation.\u00a0Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video or music streaming services, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers."

The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses.

In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Therefore, we primarily access EBS spectrum through long-term leasing arrangements with EBS license holders. Our EBS spectrum leases typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the EBS license, with an option to renew the lease for additional terms, for a total lease term of up to 30 years. On April 27, 2020, the FCC lifted the restriction on who can hold EBS licenses and the 30-year limitation on lease duration, among other changes. T-Mobile has started to acquire some of these EBS licenses but we continue to lease most of our spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time. The elimination of these restrictions will allow and may encourage current license holders to sell their licenses to other parties, including to T-Mobile. While a majority of our leases have contractual provisions enabling us to match offers, we may be forced to compete with others to purchase 2.5 GHz licenses on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated."

If our new services fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if costs associated with these services are higher than anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, brand, financial condition and operating results."

Pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, DISH has agreed to purchase all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum (approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide spectrum) for a total of approximately $3.6 billion; provided, however, that if DISH breaches the Spectrum Purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing conditions, DISH\u2019s sole liability will be to pay us a fee of approximately $72 million. In such instance, T-Mobile may be required to conduct an auction sale of all of Sprint\u2019s 800 MHz spectrum under the terms set forth in the Consent Decree, but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount less than $3.6 billion.

Management believes analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental measures to evaluate overall operating performance and facilitate comparisons with other wireless communications services companies because they are indicative of our ongoing operating performance and trends by excluding the impact of interest expense from financing, non-cash depreciation and amortization from capital investments, stock-based compensation, Merger-related costs including network decommissioning costs and incremental costs directly attributable to the Pandemic, as they are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance, as well as certain other nonrecurring income and expenses. Management believes analysts and investors use Core Adjusted EBITDA because it normalizes for the transition in the Company\u2019s device financing strategy, by excluding the impact of device lease revenues from Adjusted EBITDA, to align with the exclusion of the related depreciation expense on leased devices from Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Core Adjusted EBITDA and Core Adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for income from operations, net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d)."

We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit\u2019s fair value; however, the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We employed a qualitative approach to assess the wireless reporting unit. The fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using a market approach, which is based on market capitalization. We recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor changes in market capitalization to determine whether declines, if any, necessitate an interim impairment review. In the event market capitalization does decline below its book value, we will consider the length, severity and reasons for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists, including considering whether a control premium should be added to the market capitalization. We believe short-term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value.

Accordingly, we no longer identify Layer3 as its own reporting unit as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, while Layer3 was still identified as its own reporting unit, we determined that our enhanced in-home broadband opportunity following the Merger, along with the acquisition of certain content rights, created a strategic shift in our TVisionTM services offering that indicated that the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill assigned to the Layer3 reporting unit should be evaluated for impairment. As a result, we completed an interim goodwill impairment evaluation and determined the carrying value of the Layer3 reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment loss of $218 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, all of which relates to the impairment recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2020.

The value of the spectrum licenses can be considered as equal to the present value of the cash flows of this hypothetical start-up company. We base the assumptions underlying the Greenfield methodology on a combination of market participant data and our historical results, trends and business plans. Future cash flows in the Greenfield methodology are based on estimates and assumptions of market participant revenues, EBITDA margin, network build-out period and a long-term growth rate for a market participant.

For performance obligations related to equipment contracts, the Company typically transfers control at a point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to, and accepted by, the customer or dealer. Management estimates variable consideration (e.g., device returns or certain payments to indirect dealers) primarily based on historical experience. Promotional equipment installment plan bill credits offered to a customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining a service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether a substantive penalty is deemed to exist. Lease revenues are recorded as equipment revenues and recognized as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term."
