More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks.

The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program. The ACP provides qualifying customers up to thirty dollars per month (or seventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. These funds are in addition to or replacements for other significant pandemic-related funds designated or that could be used for broadband deployment and subscription.
