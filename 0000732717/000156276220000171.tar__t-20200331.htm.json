ASU 2016-13 affects trade receivables, loans, contract assets, certain beneficial interests, off-balance-sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance and other financial assets that are not subject to fair value through net income, as defined by the standard. Under the expected credit loss model, we are required to consider future economic trends to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Upon adoption, we recorded a $293 reduction to \u201cRetained earnings,\u201d $395 increase to \u201callowances for doubtful accounts\u201d applicable to our trade and loan receivables, $10 reduction of contract assets, $105 reduction of net deferred income tax liability and $7 reduction of \u201cNoncontrolling interest\u201d as an opening adjustment.

At March 31, 2020, we had posted collateral of $2,809 (a deposit asset) and held no collateral. Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded one rating level by Fitch Ratings before the end of March, we would not have been required to post any additional collateral. If AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded four rating levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P, and two levels by Moody\u2019s, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $6,149. If DIRECTV Holdings LLC\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded below BBB- (S&P), we would have been required to post additional collateral of $200. At December 31, 2019, we had posted collateral of $204 (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $44 (a receipt liability). We do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments."

In the first quarter of 2020, we expanded the program limit to $5,300. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the program, resulting in our gross receivables sold exceeding net cash flow impacts (e.g., collect and reinvest). The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries, which hold additional receivables in the amount of $4,057 that are pledged as collateral under this agreement. The transfers are recorded at fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. The obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated expected credit losses. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the amount outstanding."

Nonetheless, over the ensuing two decades, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. In addition, we are pursuing, at both the state and federal levels, additional legislative and regulatory measures to reduce regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive telecommunications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition."

Federal regulations also can delay and impede the deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services, including small cell equipment. In March, August and September 2018, the FCC adopted orders to streamline federal and local wireless infrastructure review processes in order to facilitate deployment of next-generation wireless facilities. Specifically, the FCC\u2019s March 2018 Order streamlined historical, tribal, and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure, including by excluding most small cell facilities from such review. The Order was appealed and in August 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FCC\u2019s finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review, but otherwise upheld the FCC\u2019s Order.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and may continue to cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products. In certain limited circumstances, suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion. In such limited circumstances, we have been unable to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers. It is possible that, in some circumstances, we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results."

To date, mitigation measures have caused sports leagues to suspend operations as well as the cancellation of many sporting events, including the NCAA tournament, which has adversely affected our advertising revenues, may result in contract disputes concerning carriage rights and will also cause us to incur expenses relating to these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation. The closure, or the avoidance, of theaters, and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by COVID-19, are expected to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our Warner Media business over the long term. If the mitigating measures or the associated effects are prolonged, we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will reduce or terminate services, having a negative effect on the performance of our Business Wireline business unit. Further, concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic could result in the prolonged closure of many of our retail stores and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the mitigation measures subside. These pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services. We may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations resulting in delays in service. Further reductions in staffing levels could further limit our ability to provide services, adversely impacting our competitive position. We may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends; extended cancellation periods; and increased labor costs if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period."
