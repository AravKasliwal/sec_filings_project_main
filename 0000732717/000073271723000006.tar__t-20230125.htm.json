Expenses also included $1.4 billion of wireline conduit asset abandonments and $0.5 billion of restructuring and other impairment charges. Also contributing to expense increases were higher bad debt expense and increased depreciation, partially offset by lower wireless equipment costs from lower volumes and the lack of 3G network shutdown costs in the fourth quarter of 2022.
