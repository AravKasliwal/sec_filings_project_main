The results compare with a reported loss from continuing operations of $(23.1) billion, or $(3.20) per share, in the fourth quarter of 2022, which included amounts totaling to $(29.4) billion (pre-tax) resulting from the following significant items (per share):  $(3.57) of noncash impairment, abandonment and restructuring charges, $(0.19) of actuarial losses, $(0.04) of DIRECTV intangible amortization, $(0.04) of other benefit related market-driven adjustments, partially offset by $0.04 of benefits from tax items. The dilutive impact of $(0.01) per share from the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06 (ASU 2020-06) was not included in our computation of earnings per share in 2022 because its effect is antidilutive as a result of the net loss.
