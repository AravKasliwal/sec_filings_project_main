We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $59 from accumulated OCI to \u201cInterest expense\u201d due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks."

Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC\u2019s regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition."

On April 26, 2024, the Second Circuit overturned a lower court\u2019s decision that the New York statute was preempted, which could have the effect of restarting the Vermont litigation.

The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas through the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Programs. NTIA and states are in the process of administering these grants. Where appropriate, AT&T may apply for grants under this or other government infrastructure programs. The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit program (established in December 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). Qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month (or seventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. AT&T is a participating provider in the ACP program. Absent additional funding, on January 11, 2024 the FCC announced that it currently projects April 2024 to be the last month providers will be fully reimbursed for the ACP benefit provided to enrolled households and established February 7, 2024 as the last date for new enrollments into the program. On March 4, 2024, the FCC issued a Public Notice confirming that April 2024 is the last fully funded month for the ACP benefit."
