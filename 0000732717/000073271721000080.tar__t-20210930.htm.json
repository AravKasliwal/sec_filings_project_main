We received the licenses in July 2021 and classified the auction deposits, related capitalized interest and billed relocation costs as \u201cLicenses - Net\u201d on our September 30, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. We estimate that we will be responsible for $955 of Incentive Payments upon clearing of Phase I spectrum, expected by the end of 2021, and $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum, expected by the end of 2023. Additionally, we are responsible for approximately $1,000 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators, of which $650 was billed in the third quarter and paid in the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in \u201cAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use.

In the second quarter of 2021, we classified the Vrio disposal group as held-for-sale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in a noncash, pre-tax impairment charge of $4,555, including approximately $2,100 related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and $2,500 related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Approximately $80 of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest. At September 30, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included $853 of Vrio held-for-sale assets reported in \u201cPrepaid and other current assets,\u201d primarily related to deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs, prepaids and other deferred charges, and $2,819 of related liabilities reported in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities,\u201d primarily for reserves associated with accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments, which will reverse against accumulated other comprehensive income upon close of the transaction.

As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV. As a result, effective August 1, 2021, we accounted for our investments in DIRECTV under the equity method and recorded our share of DIRECTV earnings as equity in net income of affiliates as DIRECTV is considered a related party upon deconsolidation. Our share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive non-proportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors. In the event that DIRECTV records a loss, that loss will be allocated to ownership interests based on their seniority, beginning with the most subordinated interests."

For the two months ended September\u00a030, 2021, our share of DIRECTV\u2019s earnings included in equity in net income of affiliates was $157.

Over the past several years, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks.
