Nonetheless, since then, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained, re-imposed or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. Recently, the FCC\u2019s regulatory approach has depended on control of the executive branch, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations in a number of areas, while imposing or re-imposing regulations in other areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition."

NTIA and states are in the process of administering these grants. Where appropriate, AT&T has applied for, and in some cases has been awarded, and may continue to apply for grants under this or other government infrastructure programs. The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit program (established in December 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). Qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month (or seventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. AT&T participated in the ACP program. On March 4, 2024, the FCC announced that absent additional funding from Congress, April 2024 would be the last fully funded month for the ACP benefit. The ACP has now ended."

Cyberattacks can cause equipment or network failures, copying or loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or proprietary information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 operations, which could result in significant expenses, potential investigations and legal liability, a loss of current or future customers and reputational damage. As our networks evolve, they are becoming increasingly reliant on software and cloud technologies to handle growing demands for data consumption. Cyberattacks against the Company and its suppliers and vendors have occurred in the past, will continue to occur in the future and are increasing in frequency, scope and potential harm over time. For example, in July 2024, the Company disclosed a cybersecurity incident on Item 1.05 of Form 8-K relating to the copying of mobile customer call data."

Further, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our suppliers, vendors and other service providers. In addition, despite our efforts to detect unlawful intrusions, an attack may persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it may take considerable time for us to obtain sufficient information about the nature, scope and timing of the incident as well as the impact or reasonably likely impact on us. Indeed, as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, a post-attack investigation may not be able to ascertain the entire scope of the attack\u2019s impact."
