We estimate that we will be responsible for $955 of Incentive Payments upon clearing of Phase I spectrum and $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum. Additionally, we will be responsible for approximately $1,000 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators. Cash paid, including deposits and refunds, for spectrum is included in \u201cAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows.

DTC subscription revenues were $1,810 versus $1,338 in the year-ago quarter and include growth from intercompany relationships with the Communications segment. Advertising revenues improved when compared to the prior year resulting from the return in 2021 of the NCAA Division I Men's Championship Basketball Tournament.

More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks.

Between 2018 and 2019, the FCC streamlined multiple federal wireless structure review processes with the potential to delay and impede deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services, including small cell equipment. Recognizing that state and local regulations have the same potential, in November 2020 the FCC adopted an order tightening the limits on state and local authority to deny requests to use existing structures for wireless facilities.
