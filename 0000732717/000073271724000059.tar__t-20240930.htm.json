The updated plans reflected lower long-term projected future cash flows associated with the industry-wide secular decline, including a faster-than-previously anticipated decline of legacy services. We identified this as an impairment indicator and performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test of our Business Wireline reporting unit. The interim impairment test methodology was consistent with our approach for annual impairment testing, using similar models updated with our current view of key inputs and assumptions. We concluded that the calculated fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit was lower than the book value, resulting in a goodwill impairment. As a result, in the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $4,422 in our consolidated statements of income, which represented the entirety of Business Wireline reporting unit goodwill. \u201cGoodwill \u2013 Net\u201d included on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 totaled $63,432, which is attributable to our Mobility and Consumer Wireline reporting units in the Communications segment.
