While our intent is to settle the Mobility preferred interests in cash, the ability to settle this instrument in AT&T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. On April 5, 2023, we repurchased the remaining Mobility preferred interests and our calculation of diluted earnings per share will not reflect the dilutive potential of these instruments for the quarterly periods after the repurchase."

More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks.
