We provided to the FCC an upfront deposit of $550 in 2020 and cash payments totaling $22,856 in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $23,406 to date. The licenses were granted by the FCC in July 2021 and remain subject to clearing. We estimate that we will be responsible for $955 of Incentive Payments upon clearing of Phase I spectrum, expected by the end of 2021, and $2,112 upon clearing of Phase II spectrum, expected by the end of 2023.  Additionally, we will be responsible for approximately $1,000 of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators. Cash paid, including deposits and refunds, for spectrum and capitalized interest is included in \u201cAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Funding for the purchase price of the spectrum included a combination of cash on hand and short-term investments, as well as short- and long-term debt."

The revenue increase was driven by higher content, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) subscription and advertising revenues in our WarnerMedia segment; Mobility equipment and service revenue growth and gains in broadband service in our Communications segment; and growth in Mexico wireless operations and favorable foreign exchange impacts. This increase was partially offset by declines in our Video business and lower Business Wireline revenues resulting from higher demand for pandemic-related connectivity in the prior-year. Operating revenues in 2021 were also impacted by the absence of revenue from our wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands which were sold in the fourth quarter of 2020."

The expense increase was primarily due to a noncash impairment charge of $4,555 resulting from our assessment of the recoverability of the net assets of Vrio, including approximately $2,100 of historical currency translation adjustments (see Note 8). The expense increase was also driven in part by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from higher smartphone sales, higher sports-related programming costs, and additional DTC programming and marketing costs. Also contributing to the higher comparative expenses was the first-quarter 2020 gain on spectrum transaction, which did not recur in 2021. Partially offsetting the expense increases were severance charges in the prior-year quarter and lower Video costs in the current year."
