These results compare with a reported net income from continuing operations of $5.1 billion, or $0.65 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2022, which included $0.11 per share of actuarial gains, $(0.04) per share from our proportionate share of DIRECTV intangible amortization, $(0.05) per share of other items, including benefit related market-driven adjustments, and $(0.01) per share related to ASU 2020-06.
