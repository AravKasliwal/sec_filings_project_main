These expense decreases were partially offset by higher programming and production costs associated with the shift of sports from the first half of the year, higher HBO Max investments and incremental COVID-19 costs.

Partially offsetting the increases were unfavorable foreign exchange rates and lower subscription revenues at regional sports networks. Turner operating expenses totaled $2.2 billion, up 41.2 percent versus the third quarter of 2019, driven by the timing of approximately $600 million in sports costs associated primarily with the restart of the NBA season and higher marketing expenses.
