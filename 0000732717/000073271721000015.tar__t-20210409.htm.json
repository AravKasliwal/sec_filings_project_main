For the quarter ended March 31, 2021, we expect to record a non-cash pre-tax actuarial gain of approximately $2.8 billion, which is primarily due to an increase in the discount rate used to measure the obligation. We recognize actuarial gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations in our consolidated results as a component of other income (expense). This gain will be included in our reported results but excluded in adjusted earnings, consistent with our historical practice for actuarial gains and losses."

In conjunction with finalizing the deal terms of our previously announced Video transaction with TPG, we have refined these allocations, specifically shared infrastructure and deferred customer acquisition costs, to reflect how the businesses are being managed today. This recast will result in a reduction of Consumer Wireline operating income by approximately $100 million per quarter in 2020 with a corresponding increase to Video historical results."
