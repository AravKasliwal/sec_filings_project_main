This resulted in a decline in digital sports revenues (content and other) as well as lower advertising revenues. Advertising revenue declines were also due to lower overall ratings that unfavorably impacted Turner's domestic entertainment networks delivery, partially offset by higher news delivery during the general election. Growth in subscription revenues from higher domestic affiliate rates, partially offset by lower regional sports network revenues and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Turner operating expenses totaled $1.9 billion, down 5.8 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by lower programming and production costs, including sports costs associated with the delayed start of the NBA season. Turner operating income margin was 42.0 percent compared to 38.8 percent in the year-earlier quarter."
