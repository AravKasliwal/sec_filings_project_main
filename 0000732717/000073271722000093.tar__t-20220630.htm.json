While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash, the ability to settle this instrument in AT&T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. The numerator includes an adjustment to add back to income the earned distributions on the Mobility II preferred interests, included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, and the denominator includes the potential issuance of AT&T common stock to settle the Mobility II preferred interests outstanding.

Expense increases were also driven by higher domestic wireless equipment expense from subscriber growth and the sale of higher-priced smartphones, increased wholesale network access charges, increased bad debt expense and 3G network shutdown costs in the first quarter of 2022.

Each AT&T shareholder was entitled to receive 0.241917 shares of WBD common stock for each share of AT&T common stock held as of the record date, which represented approximately 71% of WBD. In connection with and in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), prior to the distribution and merger, AT&T received approximately $40,400, which includes $38,800 of Spinco cash and $1,600 of debt retained by WarnerMedia. During the second quarter, assets of approximately $121,100 and liabilities of $70,600 were removed from our balance sheet as well as $45,041 of retained earnings and $5,632 of additional paid-in capital associated with the transaction. Additionally, in August 2022, we and WBD finalized the post-closing adjustment, pursuant to section 1.3 of the SDA, which will result in a $1,200 payment to WBD in the third quarter and is reflected in the accompanying June 30, 2022 balance sheet as an adjustment to additional paid in capital. The payment will be accounted for as cash used in financing activities in our statement of cash flows in third quarter of 2022. (See Notes 8 and 13)"
