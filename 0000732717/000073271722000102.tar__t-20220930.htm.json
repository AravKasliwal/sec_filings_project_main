While our intent is to settle the Mobility II preferred interests in cash, the ability to settle this instrument in AT&T shares will result in additional dilutive impact, the magnitude of which is influenced by the fair value of the Mobility II preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period, which could vary from period-to-period. The numerator includes an adjustment to add back to income the earned distributions on the Mobility II preferred interests, included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest, and the denominator includes the potential issuance of AT&T common stock to settle the Mobility II preferred interests outstanding.

Each AT&T shareholder was entitled to receive 0.241917 shares of WBD common stock for each share of AT&T common stock held as of the record date, which represented approximately 71% of WBD. In connection with and in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), prior to the distribution and merger, AT&T received approximately $40,400, which includes $38,800 of Spinco cash and $1,600 of debt retained by WarnerMedia. During the second quarter, assets of approximately $121,100 and liabilities of $70,600 were removed from our balance sheet as well as $45,041 of retained earnings and $5,632 of additional paid-in capital associated with the transaction. Additionally, in August 2022, we and WBD finalized the post-closing adjustment, pursuant to section 1.3 of the SDA, which resulted in a $1,200 payment to WBD in the third quarter of 2022. The $1,200 post-closing adjustment was included in the change in additional paid-in capital for the three months ended June 30, 2022, and for balance sheets ended June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022.

The declines were partially offset by higher wholesale access network costs for the nine-month period.

Also contributing to the decline was lower amortization of deferred fulfillment costs, including our first-quarter 2022 updates to the estimated economic lives of broadband/fiber subscribers, which decreased expenses approximately $30 in the third quarter and $110 for the first nine months of 2022.

During the second quarter, assets of approximately $121,100 and liabilities of $70,600 were removed from our balance sheet as well as $45,041 of retained earnings and $5,632 of additional paid-in capital associated with the transaction. Additionally, in August 2022, we and WBD finalized the post-closing adjustment, pursuant to section 1.3 of the SDA, which resulted in a $1,200 payment to WBD in the third quarter of 2022.

Although our credit policies have been consistent over the last few years, customer collections began to trend slower in the latter half of the second quarter of 2022 and remained relatively stable in the third quarter when compared to the second quarter of 2022, as customers returned to pre-pandemic payment trends. Stimulus payments during the pandemic contributed to better collection and bad debt expense trends than historical levels. Specifically, while bad debt expense was slightly higher than 2021, partially due to growth in our account base, it was relatively consistent with 2019 (pre-pandemic) levels."
