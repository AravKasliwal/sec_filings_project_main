The definitive agreements provide for a transaction pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the agreements, the Company will transfer the business, operations and activities that constitute the WarnerMedia segment of the Company, subject to certain exceptions (as set forth in the Separation Agreement), to Spinco (the \u201cSeparation\u201d). In connection with the Separation, Spinco will remain obligated for certain debt of the existing WarnerMedia business, make a cash payment to the Company, and in certain circumstances issue certain debt securities to the Company. After the Separation, the Company will distribute to its stockholders the shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Spinco (the \u201cSpinco Common Stock\u201d) held by the Company by way of either a pro rata dividend or an exchange offer (the \u201cDistribution\u201d). After the Distribution, Merger Sub will be merged with and into Spinco, with Spinco as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Discovery (the \u201cMerger\u201d). Following the completion of the Merger, holders of the shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the \u201cCompany Common Stock\u201d) (as holders of Spinco Common Stock immediately following the Distribution) will own approximately 71% of the outstanding capital stock of Discovery on a fully diluted basis (computed using the treasury method). The transactions are expected to be tax-free to stockholders of the Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent that cash is paid to stockholders of the Company in lieu of fractional shares in the Distribution or the Merger."
