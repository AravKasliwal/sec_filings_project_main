The pro-rated grant of deferred stock units will equal $220,000 divided by the fair market value of a share of AT&T common stock on the last trading day in the calendar month in which such award is made, pro-rated based on the number of days served by such director prior to the next annual meeting (using an assumed next annual meeting date one year following the last annual meeting). The amendment is effective June 1, 2021, prior to the election of Mr.\u00a0Ubi\u00f1as."
