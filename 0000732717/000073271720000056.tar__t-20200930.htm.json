More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. In addition, we are pursuing, at both the state and federal levels, additional legislative and regulatory measures to reduce regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive telecommunications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks.

Federal regulations also can delay and impede the deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services, including small cell equipment. In March, August and September 2018, the FCC adopted orders to streamline federal and local wireless infrastructure review processes in order to facilitate deployment of next-generation wireless facilities. Specifically, the FCC\u2019s March 2018 Order streamlined historical, tribal, and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure, including the exclusion of most small cell facilities from such review. The Order was appealed and in August 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FCC\u2019s finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review, but otherwise upheld the FCC\u2019s Order. The FCC\u2019s August and September 2018 Orders simplified the regulations for attaching telecommunications equipment to utility poles and clarified when local government right-of-way access and use restrictions can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunications services. Those orders were appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which in August 2020 largely upheld the FCC Orders. In addition to the FCC\u2019s actions, to date, 28 states and Puerto Rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment. "

To date, mitigation measures have caused sports leagues to suspend certain operations as the cancellation of many sporting events, including the NCAA tournament, which has adversely affected our advertising revenues, may result in contract disputes concerning carriage rights and has caused us to incur expenses relating to certain of these sporting events notwithstanding their cancellation. The closure, or the avoidance, of theaters, and the interruptions in movie production and other programming caused by COVID-19, are expected to impact the timing of revenues and may cause a loss of revenue to our Warner Media business over the long term. The number of subscribers to traditional linear programming in the U.S. has been declining in recent years, a trend that the current pandemic has accelerated, which has negatively affected subscription revenues, and this trend is expected to continue. If the mitigating measures or the associated effects are prolonged, we expect business customers in industries most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate services, having a negative effect on the performance of our Business Wireline business unit. Further, concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic could again result in the prolonged closure of many of our retail stores and deter customers from accessing our stores even as the mitigation measures subside. These pandemic concerns may also result in continued impact to our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services. We may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenues due to a downturn in international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and could further cause reduced staffing levels at our call centers and field operations resulting in delays in service. Further reductions in staffing levels could further limit our ability to provide services, adversely impacting our competitive position. We may also incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments required to meet higher network utilization from more customers consuming bandwidth from changes in work from home trends; extended cancellation periods; and increased labor costs if the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period."
