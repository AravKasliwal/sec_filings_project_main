Upon adoption, we recorded a $293 reduction to \u201cRetained earnings,\u201d $395 increase to \u201callowances for doubtful accounts\u201d applicable to our trade and loan receivables, $10 reduction of contract assets, $105 reduction of net deferred income tax liability and $7 reduction of \u201cNoncontrolling interest\u201d as an opening adjustment.

We consolidated that business upon close and recorded those assets at fair value, including $640 of trade names, $271 of distribution networks and $343 of goodwill that is reported in the WarnerMedia segment.

More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. In addition, we are pursuing, at both the state and federal levels, additional legislative and regulatory measures to reduce regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive telecommunications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks.

Federal regulations also can delay and impede the deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services, including small cell equipment. In March, August and September 2018, the FCC adopted orders to streamline federal and local wireless infrastructure review processes in order to facilitate deployment of next-generation wireless facilities. Specifically, the FCC\u2019s March 2018 Order streamlined historical, tribal, and environmental review requirements for wireless infrastructure, including by excluding most small cell facilities from such review. The Order was appealed and in August 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FCC\u2019s finding that most small cell facilities are excluded from review, but otherwise upheld the FCC\u2019s Order. The FCC\u2019s August and September 2018 Orders simplified the regulations for attaching telecommunications equipment to utility poles and clarified when local government right-of-way access and use restrictions can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunications services. Those orders were appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where they remain pending. In addition to the FCC\u2019s actions, to date, 28 states and Puerto Rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment. "
