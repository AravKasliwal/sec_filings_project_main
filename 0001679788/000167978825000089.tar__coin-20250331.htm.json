The Company holds crypto assets and USDC in custodial products on its platform on behalf of its customers totaling $327.5 billion and $404.0 billion at fair value at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These assets are not recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Similarly, as the Company has an obligation to securely store all of these assets, it has a corresponding unrecognized liability of $327.5 billion and $404.0 billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Since the risk of loss is remote, the Company did not recognize a contingent liability at March 31, 2025 or December 31, 2024. The Company has no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of crypto assets within its control, and (iii) it has established security around custodial product private keys to minimize the risk of theft or loss."

On March 11, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding Coinbase, Inc. and Brian Armstrong as defendants and adding causes of action, including alleging claims under Sections 5, 12(a)(1) and 15 of the Securities Act and violations of certain New Jersey state statutes. Among other relief requested, the plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, unspecified damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. On February 1, 2023, the District Court dismissed all federal claims (with prejudice) and state law claims (without prejudice) against Coinbase Global, Inc., Coinbase, Inc. and Brian Armstrong. Subsequently, on February 9, 2023, the plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the \u201cCourt of Appeals\u201d), and the parties completed briefing the appeal on September 13, 2023.

On June 27, 2024, defendants filed an answer to the amended complaint, and on July 29, 2024, the defendants filed a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings requesting the District Court dismiss the remaining claims. On February 7, 2025, the District Court denied defendants\u2019 Motion for Judgement on the Pleadings and allowed the case to proceed to bifurcated discovery, followed by summary judgment motions.

In the second quarter of 2025, we expect technology and development and general and administrative expenses to decline as compared to the first quarter of 2025, driven by lower variable customer support expenses and seasonally lower payroll taxes. Additionally, we expect sales and marketing expenses to grow modestly, as compared to the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to expected higher USDC rewards expense and brand marketing spend seasonality."
