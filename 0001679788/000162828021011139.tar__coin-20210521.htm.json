Mr. Armstrong\u2019s voting power increased to over 50% of the total voting power of the Company as a result of sales and/or transfers by other stockholders of the Company of Class B common stock, which pursuant to the terms of the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation resulted in the conversion of their shares from Class B common stock (which is entitled to twenty votes per share) to Class A common stock (which is entitled to one vote per share), effectively decreasing the voting power percentages of such other stockholders relative to Mr. Armstrong. Such change was not the result of any purchase of the Company\u2019s capital stock by Mr. Armstrong. As a result of future sales or issuances of capital stock by the Company, and/or exercises, settlements or conversions of options, warrants or restricted stock units, and additional conversions of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock, Mr. Armstrong\u2019s voting power will fluctuate and may in the future decrease below, and then back above, 50% of the total voting power of the Company."
