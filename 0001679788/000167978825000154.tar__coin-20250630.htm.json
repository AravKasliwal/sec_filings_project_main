The Company has not incurred any losses related to such obligations and therefore has not accrued any liabilities as of each June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Company holds crypto assets and USDC in custodial products on its platform on behalf of its customers totaling $425.0 billion and $404.0 billion at fair value at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. These assets are not recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Similarly, as the Company has an obligation to securely store all of these assets, it has a corresponding unrecognized liability of $425.0 billion and $404.0 billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Since the risk of loss is remote, the Company did not recognize a contingent liability at June 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. The Company has no reason to believe it will incur any expense associated with such potential liability because (i) it has no known or historical experience of claims to use as a basis of measurement, (ii) it accounts for and continually verifies the amount of crypto assets within its control, and (iii) it has established security around custodial product private keys to minimize the risk of theft or loss."

Infrastructure upgrades included Base Chain\u2019s decentralization milestones, faster transaction speeds, and expanded stablecoin distribution.

Trading Volume does not include derivatives volume on our platform or trades executed on third-party venues. Trading Volume represents the product of the quantity of assets transacted and the trade price at the time the transaction was executed. As trading activity directly impacts transaction revenue, we believe this measure is a reflection of liquidity on our order books, trading health, and the underlying growth of the cryptoeconomy. Institutions incur lower fees per transaction than consumers and, as a result, the impact of changes in consumer Trading Volume on transaction revenue is more pronounced than the impact of changes in institutional Trading Volume."
