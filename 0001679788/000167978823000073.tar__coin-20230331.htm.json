The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, market presence, synergies, and the use of purchased technology to develop future products and technologies. The final allocation of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain balances, estimates, and assumptions during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Any changes in the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a measurement period adjustment associated with deferred tax assets was recorded, resulting in an increase in other non-current assets of $0.3\u00a0million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill."

The Company has adopted a number of measures to safeguard crypto assets it secures including, but not limited to, holding customer crypto assets on a 1:1 basis and strategically storing custodied assets offline using the Company\u2019s cold storage process. The Company also does not reuse or rehypothecate customer crypto assets nor grant security interests in customer crypto assets, in each case unless required by law or expressly agreed to by the customer.

These already weakening market conditions were exasperated by the events of 2022. The first was the depegging of $LUNA in the second quarter of 2022 which contributed to approximately 60% crypto market capitalization decline in that quarter and ultimately drove the credit related bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager and Celsius. The second event was the collapse of FTX in the fourth quarter of 2022, which drove additional credit related bankruptcies. These events contributed to an overall market capitalization decline of 64% or approximately $1.5 trillion of value lost in 2022 which in turn impacted overall industry trading volume and more specifically Coinbase Trading Volume and transaction revenues in the three months ended March 31, 2023."

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other non-cash and non-recurring items, Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business."

Our ability to meet our requirements and plans for cash, including meeting our working capital and capital expenditure requirements, will depend on many factors, including market acceptance of crypto assets and blockchain technology, our growth, our ability to attract and retain customers on our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our products and services, the introduction of new subscription products and services on our platform, expansion of sales and marketing activities, and overall economic conditions. We anticipate satisfying our short-term cash requirements with our existing cash and cash equivalents and may satisfy our long-term cash requirements with cash and cash equivalents on hand or with proceeds from a future equity or debt financing."

The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. As a result of our downgrade, our ability to raise additional financing from external sources in the future may be adversely affected and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, even if debt financing is available, the cost of additional financing may be significantly higher than our current debt."
