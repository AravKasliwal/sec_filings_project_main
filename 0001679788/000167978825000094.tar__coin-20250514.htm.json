(\u201cCoinbase\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), received an email communication from an unknown threat actor claiming to have obtained information about certain Coinbase customer accounts, as well as internal Coinbase documentation, including materials relating to customer-service and account-management systems. The communication demanded money in exchange for not publicly disclosing the information. The threat actor appears to have obtained this information by paying multiple contractors or employees working in support roles outside the United States to collect information from internal Coinbase systems to which they had access in order to perform their job responsibilities. These instances of such personnel accessing data without business need were independently detected by the Company\u2019s security monitoring in the previous months. Upon discovery, the Company had immediately terminated the personnel involved and also implemented heightened fraud-monitoring protections and warned customers whose information was potentially accessed in order to prevent misuse of any compromised information. Since receipt of the email, the Company has assessed the email to be credible, and has concluded that these prior instances of improper data access were part of a single campaign (the \u201cIncident\u201d) that succeeded in taking data from internal systems. The Company has not paid the threat actor\u2019s demand and is cooperating with law enforcement in the investigation of this Incident."
