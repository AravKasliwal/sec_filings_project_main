The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, synergies, and the use of purchased technology to develop future products and technologies. The final allocation of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain balances, estimates, and assumptions during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Any changes in the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a measurement period adjustment associated with deferred tax assets was recorded, resulting in an increase in other non-current assets of $4.1\u00a0million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill."

The goodwill balance is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce, market presence, synergies, and the use of purchased technology to develop future products and technologies. The final allocation of purchase consideration to assets and liabilities remains in process as the Company continues to evaluate certain balances, estimates, and assumptions during the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Any changes in the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in adjustments to goodwill. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a measurement period adjustment associated with deferred tax assets was recorded, resulting in an increase in other non-current assets of $0.3\u00a0million and a corresponding reduction in goodwill."

The most common form today is participating in proof-of-stake networks, however, there are other consensus algorithms.

In exchange for participating in the consensus mechanism of these networks, the Company recognizes revenue in the form of the native token of the network. Each block creation or validation is a performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point when the block creation or validation is complete and the rewards are transferred into a digital wallet that the Company controls. Revenue is measured based on the number of tokens received and the fair value of the token at contract inception.

As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. As of June 30, 2023, because crypto asset appreciation during the year provided more gains to offset losses, management determined that there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that additional deferred taxes of $60.1 million are realizable, resulting in a partial valuation allowance release of $60.1 million."

                      "text": "The decrease in both Trading Volume and Crypto Asset Volatility were driven by materially different market conditions between the quarters that have evolved over the last year. A number of factors contribute to changes in crypto asset prices and Crypto Asset Volatility, including, but not limited to, changes in the supply and demand for a particular crypto asset, crypto market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, utility of a particular crypto asset, and idiosyncratic events. The first quarter of 2022 continued a trend of both lower crypto prices and volatility that began in late 2021 driven by weaker macroeconomic conditions. These already weakening market conditions were exacerbated by the events of 2022. The first was the de-pegging of $LUNA in the second quarter of 2022 which contributed to approximately 60% crypto market capitalization decline in that quarter and ultimately drove the credit related bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager and Celsius. The second event was the collapse of FTX in the fourth quarter of 2022, which drove additional credit related bankruptcies. These events contributed to an overall market capitalization decline of 64% or approximately $1.5 trillion of value lost in 2022 which in turn impacted overall industry trading volume and more specifically Coinbase Trading Volume and transaction revenues. While the three months ended June 30, 2023 saw crypto market capitalization remain resilient, Global and US spot volumes across the industry further declined compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, driven by a reduction in crypto asset volatility. The decline in volatility, and thus overall Trading Volume, was a result of overall degraded crypto sentiment, regulatory uncertainty, bank failures and market shock events like the de-pegging of USDC in March 2023 as well as an overall reduction in liquidity."

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Among other non-cash and non-recurring items, Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison. A reconciliation is provided below for each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business."
