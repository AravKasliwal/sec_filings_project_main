The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class A Common Stock upon any conversion of the relevant series of Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes of such series, as the case may be, in the event that the market price of the Company\u2019s Class A Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the applicable strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, which initially corresponds to the conversion price of the applicable series of Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments. If, however, the market price per share of Class A Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the applicable cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the Class A Common Stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially approximately $595.98 per share, which represents a premium of 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class A Common Stock of $297.99 per share on August 5, 2025, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger; a tender offer; and a nationalization, insolvency, or delisting involving the Company. In addition, the Capped Call Transactions are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Call Transactions, including changes in law; insolvency filings and hedging disruptions."
