Based on discussions with the Staff, the Company believes these potential enforcement actions would relate to aspects of the Company\u2019s spot market, staking service Coinbase Earn, Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Wallet. The potential civil action may seek injunctive relief, disgorgement, and civil penalties. The Company published additional information on a blog related to the foregoing which can be found at www.coinbase.com/blog and on the Twitter feeds of Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) and Paul Grewal (@iampaulgrewal).
