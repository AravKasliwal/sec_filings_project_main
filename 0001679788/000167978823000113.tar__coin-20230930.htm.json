The Company has adopted a number of measures to safeguard crypto assets it secures including, but not limited to, holding customer crypto assets on a 1:1 basis and strategically storing custodied assets offline using the Company\u2019s cold storage process. The Company also does not reuse or rehypothecate customer crypto assets nor grant security interests in customer crypto assets, in each case unless required by law or expressly agreed to by the institutional customer.

The first quarter of 2022 continued a trend of both lower crypto prices and volatility that began in late 2021 driven by weaker macroeconomic conditions. These already weakening market conditions were exacerbated by the events of 2022. The first was the de-pegging of $LUNA in the second quarter of 2022 which contributed to approximately 60% crypto market capitalization decline in that quarter and ultimately drove the credit related bankruptcies of Three Arrows Capital, Voyager and Celsius. The second event was the collapse of FTX in the fourth quarter of 2022, which drove additional credit related bankruptcies. These events contributed to an overall market capitalization decline of 64% or approximately $1.5 trillion of value lost in 2022 which in turn impacted overall industry trading volume and more specifically Coinbase Trading Volume and transaction revenues. While the three months ended September 30, 2023 saw crypto market capitalization remain resilient, Global and US spot volumes across the industry further declined over the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a reduction in crypto asset volatility. The decline in volatility, and thus overall Trading Volume, was a result of overall degraded crypto sentiment, regulatory uncertainty, bank failures and market shock events like the de-pegging of USDC in March 2023 as well as an overall reduction in liquidity. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, USDT volume was elevated, largely due to de-pegging events which drove higher activity in secondary markets such as our exchange."
