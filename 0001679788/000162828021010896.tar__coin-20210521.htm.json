The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated May 21, 2021 (the \u201cIndenture\u201d), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The Indenture include customary covenants and sets forth certain events of default after which the Notes may be declared immediately due and payable and sets forth certain types of bankruptcy or insolvency events of default involving the Company after which the Notes become automatically due and payable. Pursuant to the purchase agreement between the Company and the Initial Purchasers (as defined below), the Company also granted the Initial Purchasers of the Notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $187.5 million principal amount of Notes, solely to cover over-allotments (the \u201cAdditional Notes\u201d)."

On or after December 1, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock, at the Company\u2019s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the Indenture. The conversion rate for the Notes will initially be 2.6994 shares of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $370.45 per share of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock. The initial conversion price of the Notes represents a premium of approximately 55% to the $239.00 per share last reported sale price of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock on May 18, 2021. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

LLC and Mizuho Markets Americas LLC (the \u201cOption Counterparties\u201d).

The Capped Call Transactions will cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Notes, the number of shares of Class A Common Stock underlying the Notes sold in the offering. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Class\u00a0A Common Stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. If, however, the market price per share of Class\u00a0A Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions will initially be approximately $478.00 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock of $239.00 per share on May 18, 2021, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger; a tender offer; and a nationalization, insolvency, or delisting involving the Company. In addition, the Capped Call Transactions are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Call Transactions, including changes in law; insolvency filings and hedging disruptions."
