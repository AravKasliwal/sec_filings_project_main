The Capped Call Transactions have an initial strike price of approximately $333.54 per share, subject to adjustments, which corresponds to the approximate initial conversion price of the Notes. The Capped Call Transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Class\u00a0A Common Stock that initially underlie the Notes. The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class\u00a0A Common Stock upon any conversion of Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments the Company would be required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. If, however, the market price per share of Class\u00a0A Common Stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that the then-market price per share of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions. The cap price of the Capped Call Transactions is initially approximately $503.46 per share, which represents a premium of approximately 100% over the last reported sale price of the Class\u00a0A Common Stock of $251.73 per share on March 13, 2024, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions are subject to either adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including a merger; a tender offer; and a nationalization, insolvency, or delisting involving the Company. In addition, the Capped Call Transactions are subject to certain specified additional disruption events that may give rise to a termination of the Capped Call Transactions, including changes in law; insolvency filings and hedging disruptions.",
