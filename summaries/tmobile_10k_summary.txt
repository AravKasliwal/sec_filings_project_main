## 3. CYBERSECURITY RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework Adoption

The filing states: "We utilize the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework ("NIST CSF") as a guide in cyber risk management to identify, assess, and assist the CSO in managing cybersecurity risks. Cyber risk management encompasses partnerships among teams that are responsible for cyber governance, prevention, detection, and remediation activities within the Company's cybersecurity environment."

### Integrated Risk Assessment

"Our management also conducts a quarterly enterprise-wide risk assessment that considers a wide spectrum of risks facing the Company, including cybersecurity. Through these quarterly risk assessments, management informs the Audit Committee on the cyber risk landscape facing the Company and the Company's preparedness to manage such risk. The enterprise-wide risk assessment is a top-down risk assessment that leverages the assessments performed by cyber risk management."

### Employee Training and Mitigation

"As part of our cyber risk management efforts, we conduct periodic reviews and collaborate with enterprise-wide risk assessments to assess and manage cybersecurity risks. Our cybersecurity team also provides enterprise-wide cybersecurity training for employees to continuously improve our mitigation against human-driven vulnerabilities."

## 4. THREAT LANDSCAPE AND CYBERATTACK CHARACTERISTICS

### Sophistication and Scale of Threats

The filing emphasizes: "Cyberattacks against companies like ours have increased in frequency and scope of potential harm over time, and the methods used to gain unauthorized access constantly evolve, making it increasingly difficult to anticipate, prevent, and detect incidents successfully in every instance."

**Attacker Profile:**
"They are perpetrated by a variety of groups and persons, including state-sponsored parties, malicious actors, employees, contractors, or other unrelated third parties. Some of these persons reside in jurisdictions where law enforcement measures to address such attacks are ineffective or unavailable, and such attacks may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign governments."

### Attack Methods and Objectives

The 10-K details: "We are subject to persistent cyberattacks and threats to our business from a variety of bad actors, many of whom attempt to gain unauthorized access to and compromise Confidential Information and Systems. In some cases, the bad actors exploit bugs, errors, misconfigurations or other vulnerabilities in our Systems to obtain Confidential Information. In other cases, these bad actors may obtain unauthorized access to Confidential Information by exploiting insider access or utilizing log in credentials taken from our customers, employees, or third-party providers through credential harvesting, social engineering or other means. Other bad actors aim to cause serious operational disruptions to our business and Systems through ransomware or distributed denial of services attacks."

### Future Threat Evolution

"We also expect that threat actors will continue to gain sophistication including in the use of tools and techniques (such as artificial intelligence) that are specifically designed to circumvent security controls, evade detection, and obfuscate forensic evidence, making it more challenging for us to identify, investigate and recover from future cyberattacks in a timely and effective manner."

## 5. THIRD-PARTY CYBERSECURITY RISKS

### External Cybersecurity Advisors

"The Company engages top-tier external cyber security firms, as needed, leveraging their expertise as part of our ongoing effort to evaluate and enhance our cybersecurity program. They help with cyber defense capabilities (including staff enhancement of certain functions) and transformation to mitigate associated threats, reduce risk, enhance our cybersecurity posture, and meet the Company's evolving needs."

### Third-Party Provider Dependencies

"In addition, we routinely rely upon third-party providers whose products and services are used in our business. These third-party providers have experienced in the past, and will continue to experience in the future, cyberattacks that involve attempts to obtain unauthorized access to our Confidential Information and/or to create operational disruptions that could adversely affect our business, and these providers also face other security challenges common to all parties that collect and process information."

### Limitations on Third-Party Oversight

The filing candidly states: "Additionally, we do not have control of the cybersecurity systems, breach prevention, and response protocols of our third-party providers, including through our cybersecurity programs or policies. While T-Mobile may have contractual rights to assess the effectiveness of many of our providers' systems and protocols, we do not have the means to know or assess the effectiveness of all of our providers' systems and controls at all times."

## 6. DATA TYPES AND PRIVACY OBLIGATIONS

### Categories of Sensitive Information at Risk

The 10-K defines "Confidential Information" broadly: "Our business involves the receipt, storage, and transmission of confidential information about our customers, such as sensitive personal, account and payment card information, confidential information about our employees and suppliers, and other sensitive information about our Company, such as our business plans, transactions, financial information, and intellectual property (collectively, "Confidential Information")."

### Regulatory Compliance Framework

**State Privacy Laws:**
"Since 2020, a number of states have enacted new, comprehensive privacy laws that create new data privacy rights for residents of those states and new compliance obligations for us and the industry in general, in addition to private rights of action for certain types of data breaches."

## CONCLUSION

T-Mobile's 10-K filing reveals a company managing significant cybersecurity challenges stemming from two major incidents in 2021 and 2023 that compromised the personal information of tens of millions of customers. The company has implemented governance structures involving Board-level oversight, executive leadership with relevant expertise, third-party risk management, and a NIST-based framework for cyber risk management. However, the filing also candidly acknowledges ongoing vulnerabilities, the evolving sophistication of threats (including AI-based techniques), limitations in third-party oversight, and the impossibility of providing absolute assurance against future breaches. Financial impacts from the 2021 and 2023 incidents exceed $400 million in recorded charges with ongoing litigation, regulatory inquiries, and uncertain future exposures. The company faces ongoing challenges in modernizing legacy systems, managing third-party cybersecurity risks, and complying with evolving state and federal privacy regulations.
